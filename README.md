# ChronoSense

ChronoSense is a fun and simple SwiftUI app that helps you test your internal body clock!  
Select a time in seconds, tap **Start**, and try to **Stop** exactly when you think that much time has elapsed.  
Compare your target time vs. your actual timing and see how accurate your internal clock can be!

## Features

- **Carousel Time Selection**: Scroll horizontally to pick a duration (5s…100s).  
- **Timer Challenge**: Tap **Start**, then tap **Stop** when you believe your chosen time is up.  
- **Results Screen**: Shows your target time, actual time, and the difference.  
- **History**: Stores your previous attempts (if you enable it), so you can compare how your sense of time improves.  
- **Onboarding**: First-time users will see a quick overview of how to use the app.  

## Privacy & Data Collection

**ChronoSense does not collect any personal data.**
All timing results and any history data are stored locally on your device via `UserDefaults`. No tracking or analytics are performed. No data is uploaded to any server, and no personally identifiable information is collected or shared.

## Usage Tips

- **Start a session**: Pick a duration (e.g., 20s).  
- **Tap “Start”**: Timer begins in the background.  
- **Try to Stop** when you think the chosen time has elapsed.  
- **Compare** your actual time vs. the target.  
- **Check History** to track your improvement over multiple attempts.
